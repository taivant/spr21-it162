    <p>This is my second web authoring class and I love it a lot! I'm also taking a javascript class, which means I will be able to create a website all from scratch.</p>
    <p>As you can see I love animals, especially felids! Last quarter, my website was all about cats, but this quarter I'm planning to focus on wild cats and the importance of preserving their natural habitats and their numbers!</p>
    <p>I care about animals a lot and it hurts to know that there are innumerable wild animals and pets that are being abused and mistreated as we speak! I think this is a social issue we must not overlook, because we share our land with animals and plants. As highly intelligent human beings, we must take care of them, not hurt them out of our "free will"!</p>
