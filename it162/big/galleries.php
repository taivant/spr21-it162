          <p>When you are creating a website for yourself or your client you will probably want to use some pictures to show the visitors what the website is about and showcase the products you’re advertising. However, you can’t just put a bunch of pictures all over the place without order and context. That will do more harm than good as it will confuse the visitors and make them think that the website is either broken or very poorly made, which will frustrate them and you will lose their business or support. That is why it is important to have neat and organized galleries for your website. To create galleries for your website you will have to use HTML, CSS and some JQuery. It seems like a lot of work coding a gallery, fortunately, you’re not alone! There are many available galleries you could search on the internet like the ones I will list below! This is why coding is great because people get to share their codes and support each other!</p>
