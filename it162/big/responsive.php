          <p>You might wonder what’s the difference between a responsive website and a mobile app?  And which one is better? Well, it depends on what kind of business you are and what is your goal! A mobile app might look perfect for your business, but if you have limited budget and time then it isn’t a good choice, yet. There are different cases where a business might have one or the other or both! That is why we will compare the differences between the two.</p> 

          <p>First, let’s start with responsive websites! While your usual website is built for viewing on a desktop, a mobile site is specifically designed to appear on smaller screens like mobile phones and tablets. A responsive site has a special design based on CSS media queries.  It allows the website's content to fit into any type of screen, both a 17 inch laptop or 3 inch phone. It doesn’t require downloading or installation. In addition, most of the sites are free. Regardless of operating system, you can easily use a responsive website on your smartphone. But don’t forget one important detail – internet connection. Most websites can’t work without it! Also, the user doesn’t have to install the new version to see the enhancements on the website (Thinkmobiles). Launching a mobile site is a faster process than designing an application. Nearly all businesses these days need mobile sites to stay competitive anyway, so creating a responsive mobile experience is the least that developers can do.Responsive web design is comparatively cheap when measured against the costs of designing a native mobile app from the ground up (Smashstack).</p>

          <p>Next, mobile apps! Mobile apps work differently than responsive websites. They don’t run on all devices and need to be installed separately but what they give is unique user experience. While your website is aimed at attracting new or occasional clients your mobile app works with regular clients. Depending on the app's functions, you can download information or content and use it even without Internet access. Design for a mobile app is typically more holistic and user-friendly as it is done for a specific platform (Thinkmobile). Apps usually have faster loading times than web pages as they aren’t cluttered with unnecessary site elements.  Apps feature greater functionality than mobile-oriented sites can allow due to the way each is custom built into the device’s OS. This means that apps can easily integrate with other features and tools in a device as well as support functions that aren’t possible with web-based HTML5.
          With handy desktop shortcuts, mobile apps put you front and center on each user’s phone, and the custom code used to create apps can relay information back to businesses about user behaviors to inform future development decisions.</p>

          <p>In conclusion, if your budget is limited, then the first option should be chosen. If finances and time allow, then choose both (hyperlinkinfosystem). Having both won’t harm your business, but will maximize the number of clients and profit. However, starting with a responsive website is a must, before you jump into developing a mobile app for your business.</p>
