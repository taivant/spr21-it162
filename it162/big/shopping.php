          <p>If you are creating a business page for yourself or your client, you probably want to monetize your website, you’d especially want a shopping cart. Unfortunately, it’s not as easy as writing some HTML, adding CSS for style to create the shopping cart. It’s not like building a Gallery, it’s much more complicated. That is why there are many softwares and websites you would want to use to create a shopping cart for your web page!</p> 

          <p>There are many different types of shopping carts and it’s important to know which one is the best fit for you based on your budget, experience and the features you need. First of all, there is open-source vs software-as-a-service. The first is usually free, it may be a little too complex to work with if you are a beginner, as it requires you to work with the source code to customize the back and front end of your website. The second, on the other hand, doesn’t require you to download or do much, all you need is to subscribe to use their service. They will do the web hosting for your website! Then there are plugins vs full website builders. Plugins are integrated to an existing website and will appear to the end user as a set of dedicated products or checkout pages or simply a buy button.  Full website builders have some web design aspects with some templates and tools to help you set up your page. They are usually software-as-a-service(SAAS) that will host your page! According to MerchantMaverick, these are the best shopping carts compared!</p>
