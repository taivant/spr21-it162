                <p>Welcome to my IT 162 Final Project web page! The name of my website is WildCattos and you can access this site through my IT162 web page! WildCattos is a website about felids living in the wild unlike domestic cats! I did a separate website on domestic cats last quarter. You can check it out at <a href="http://www.taivan.xyz/it161/fp/index.html" target="_blank">CatMews.</a></p>
                <p>At WildCattos you can learn about us at our About Us page, go to our Donation page to donate at our associated links, learn about wild cat facts and news at Facts &amp; News page, look at cute wild cat pictures at our Gallery page, and contact me at Contact Us page! </p>
                <p>I didn't to this page alone! My client was my mother and she helped a lot in decision making! Out website color palette was inspired by African wild cat fur colors and their natural habitat. We have pictures and facts of wild cats like Cheetah, Serval, Caracal, Sand cat, Scottish wildcat and Pallas cat currently posted on our Facts &amp; News and Gallery page! And we are planning to add more overtime until we include all the wild cat species in the world!</p>
                <p>This project was not only fun to make, but also it support wild cat conservation. After publishing our website, we hope it will catch people's attention and direct them towards wild cat conservation organizations, educate people on why it is important to keep our wild felines habitat safe and untouched and restore their lost habitats! </p>
                <p>Wild cats are not threat nor fancy fur used for expensive clothes! They are also not medicine and exotic meat! If we help people who share land with wild cats understand that and help them employ safer methods to protect their livestocks then we might save a lot of endangered and near extinction felids!</p>
                <p>It's not just wild cats that are in danger, many other animals are also being hunt and killed or losing their habitats! We need to take action and we are starting with wild cats! We can't be selfish and disrespect and abuse animals that share the same soul and emotion with us! Just because they can't speak and that we can't prove that they are intelligent and can feel pain, doesn't mean we treat them like objects! We need to treat them like helpless children who need our help and love and a space to grow and live their life!</p>
