                <p>The name of my website is WildCattos and you can access this site through my IT162 web page! WildCattos is a website about felids living in the wild unlike domestic cats! I did a separate website on domestic cats last quarter. You can check it out at <a href="http://www.taivan.xyz/it161/fp/index.html" target="_blank">CatMews.</a></p>
                <p>At WildCattos you can learn about us at our About page, go to our Donation page to donate at our associated links, learn about wild cat facts and news at Facts &amp; News page, look at cute wild cat picture at our Gallery page, and contact me at Contact Us page! </p>
                <p>I didn't to this page alone! My client was my mother and she helped a lot in decision making! Out website color palette was inspired by African wild cat fur colors and their natural habitat. We have pictures and facts of wild cats like Cheetah, Serval, Caracal, Sand cat, Scottish wildcat and Pallas cat currently posted on our Facts &amp; News and Gallery page! And we are planning to cover more species until we include all of the wild cat species in the world!</p>

            <div class="txt">
                <p>Your donation is a massive support to wild cat conservation efforts. 100% of your donation will go towards saving wild cats and their habitats. Wild cat organizations couldn't do it alone without the help of the donators! This is the least people can do if they can't directly help conserve wild cat habitats and save wild cats!</p>
