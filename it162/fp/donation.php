                <p>Our Mission: To aid in the conservation of small wild cat species through education, public awareness and support for scientific field projects.</p>
                <p>The International Society for Endangered Cats (ISEC) Canada was incorporated as a federally registered non-profit charity in 1990 in Calgary, Alberta. None of our directors or other personnel involved receive a salary – we are a totally volunteer organization. 100% of donations and all profits from memberships and product sales go directly to small wild cat conservation.</p>
                <p>Our programs support the smallest wild cats, consisting of 40 species that weigh less than 50 lbs. We do not provide funding for the larger cats – tigers, lions, leopards, jaguars, snow leopards, cheetahs or cougar. Our main focus is providing funding for field research projects.</p>

                <p>Panthera is the only organization in the world that is devoted exclusively to the conservation of the world’s 40 wild cat species and their ecosystems.</p>
                <p>Utilizing the expertise of the world’s premier cat biologists, Panthera develops and implements global strategies for the seven species of big cats: cheetahs, leopards, jaguars, lions, pumas (also known as mountain lions or cougars), snow leopards and tigers. Panthera also studies and protects the world's most threatened species of small cats through our Small Cats Program.</p>
                <p>Representing the most comprehensive effort of its kind, Panthera partners with local and international NGOs, scientific institutions, local communities, governments around the globe and citizens who want to help ensure a future for wild cats.</p>

                <p>The biggest threat to the Scottish Wildcat is hybridisation.  More specifically, when genetically pure wildcats mate with feral cats instead of other wildcats, the gene pool becomes diluted and the species (Felis Sylvestris) literally breeds itself out of existense.</p>
                <p>Wildcat Haven was initially designed by a team of experts in 2008/09.  Since then, it has evolved to incorporate experiences from the fieldwork, emerging science and feedback from the local community. Designed to have the flexibility to evolve over time, the project can ensure we are always delivering the most well informed and practical conservation actions and animal welfare standards.</p>
                <p>Feral cats – being the primary threat to the survival of the wildcat – had to be removed from the region as a priority.  With evidence from across the globe showing that lethal-control projects often failed, we made the decision to trial a non-lethal neutering approach.</p>
                <p>We use live trapping methods to humanely capture feral cats in the area, which are subsequently health-checked and neutered by a vet.</p>
