                <p>The cheetah is widely known as the planet’s fastest land animal, but unknown to many, it is also Africa’s most threatened big cat. Today, there are estimated to be only 7,100 cheetahs left in the wild.</p>
                <p>There are estimated to be only 7,100 cheetahs left in the wild, and their future remains uncertain across their range. Extinct in 25 countries and possibly extinct in a further 13 countries, cheetahs have vanished from approximately 91 percent of their historic range. They are extinct in Asia apart from a single, isolated population of perhaps 50 individuals in central Iran.</p>
                <p>Cheetahs are listed as "Vulnerable" by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species, but <a href="https://www.panthera.org/disappearing-spots" target="_blank">after a recent study revealed significant population declines</a>, scientists are calling for cheetahs to be uplisted to "Endangered." In North Africa and Asia, they are considered "Critically Endangered."</p>
                <p>The species is threatened by conflict with local people, the illegal wildlife trade, legal sport hunting, and loss of prey due to overhunting by people and agricultural land developments. <a href="https://www.panthera.org/cat/cheetah" target="_blank">(Panthera)</a></p>

                <p>The Serval Leptailurus serval is named from a Portuguese word meaning ‘wolf-deer’. The first impression on seeing these cats is one of extremes – elongated neck, very long legs, and very large ears on a small, delicate skull. It is easy to see the ‘deer’ part of the name.</p>
                <p>The main threat to these cats is the loss and degradation of wetland habitat mostly caused by increasing urbanization and land use changes. Such wetlands show high rodent densities compared with other environments and are the core areas of serval home ranges. The degradation of grassland habitat through burning and over-grazing by livestock leads to a reduced abundance of small mammals and therefore negatively affects the cat.</p>
                <p>Even though international legal trade is declining, some trade in skins is still reported from many countries. Serval furs are often marked as “cheetah” or “leopard” fur. In West Africa, their furs are mainly used for ceremonial or medicinal purposes. Economically, the furs are of high value and they are mostly sold on local markets. The extent of the trade in their skins is not known.</p>
                <p>This cat is also killed through indiscriminate predator control methods and it is hunted for sport. They climb on trees when chased by hounds, making them an easier target.</p>
                <p>Some African tribes consider their flesh a delicacy. In rural areas throughout Africa, they are persecuted as retaliation for poultry predation. It rarely preys upon livestock, but in South Africa it is hunted for this reason. It could even be considered beneficial to farmers since it preys upon rodents. <a href="https://wildcatconservation.org/wild-cats/africa/serval/" target="_blank">(ISEC)</a></p>

                <p>Although they are called ‘desert lynx’, Caracals Caracal caracal have longer legs, a more slender body, and the tail is considerably longer than true lynx. They also lack the ruff of hairs around the face which are so predominant in the northern cats. Melanistic Caracals have been reported, though only rarely.
                The word Caracal means ‘black ears’ in Turkish. Large, tapering ears with five cm erect tufts of black hair, used for communication, are the most unique feature of this cat.</p>
                <p>The actual number of Caracal in the wild is unknown. They are considered rare or threatened in Asia and North Africa. In central and southern Africa they are considered widespread and hunted as a poultry raiders or shot on sight wherever they are found. Poisoned carcasses which kill a variety of carnivores are also put out by ranchers to kill predators.</p>
                <p>Between 1931-1952, an average of 2,219 Caracals per year were killed in South Africa during predator control operations. Namibian farmers responding to a government questionnaire reported killing up to 2,800 Caracals in 1981</p>
                <p>A study in the United Arab Emirates found 11 of 12 Caracal scats contained domestic goats or sheep, as natural prey numbers were low or absent. In a protected area of Iran, cape hare and rodents made up the bulk of the Caracal diet, and there was no predation on livestock reported. As well, no livestock remains were found in 200 scats in a South African park where wild prey was abundant.</p>
                <p>Caracals are most numerous in South Africa and Namibia, where their range is expanding, possibly due to extirpation of black-backed jackals by farmers. An additional threat is severe habitat loss. As people move further into their territory, their prey species are driven out and persecution increases.  <a href="https://wildcatconservation.org/wild-cats/africa/caracal/" target="_blank">(ISEC)</a></p>

                <p>The Sand Cat Felis margarita is a true desert dweller and are the only felid to occur exclusively in desert habitat. They have numerous adaptations to an arid life and colouring that blends in with their environment.</p>
                <p>Habitat degradation and loss are considered to be the major threats to the Sand Cat. Vulnerable arid ecosystems are being rapidly converted by human settlement and activity, especially degraded through livestock grazing.  Additional threats are the introduction of feral and domestic dogs and cats, creating direct competition for prey, predation and disease transmission. This applies particularly along roads through suitable habitat.</p>
                <p>In Iran, Sand Cats are killed by shepherd dogs and trapped in snares set for other species. They also get stuck in fences and are vulnerable to indiscriminate trapping and poisoning of predators.</p>
                <p>In the Arabian Peninsula, sand dune habitat continues to decline. Several of the areas have been affected by political strife, and war-like conditions that have accelerated habitat destruction i.e. Syria.</p>
                <p>Locally, Sand Cats may be threatened by the pet trade. There are occasional reports of Sand Cats being shot in Saudi Arabia.</p>
                <p>In Algeria, they are not considered a threat to poultry, or trapped to sell as pets. Toubou nomads living northwest of Lake Chad consider Sand Cats frequent chicken thieves which readily enter their camp in the evenings. They do not generally retaliate, due to traditional religious respect for these small cats as tradition holds that they were the companions of the Prophet Mohammed and his daughter. <a href="https://wildcatconservation.org/wild-cats/africa/sand-cat/" target="_blank">(ISEC)</a></p>

                <p>The Scottish Wildcat is the world’s rarest cat.</p>
                <p>There are only 35 Scottish wildcats remaining in the wild making this the world’s most endangered feline.</p>
                <p>The Scottish wildcat evolved from a population of European wildcats which became isolated by the English Channel over 9000 years ago. They are the largest of the wildcat family and can be double the size of a domestic pet cat and infinitely more ferocious.</p>
                <p>The fur of the Scottish wildcat is a great deal thicker than that of a domestic cat.</p>
                <p>It displays very distinctive solid black and brown stripes.  Spots, broken stripes or white fur are all indications of hybridisation (cross-mating) with domestic cats.</p>
                <p>Another notable feature is their thick banded tail, perfectly ringed with no dorsal stripe running off of the spine.  Imperfect rings or dorsal markings are further signs of hybridisation.</p>
                <p>The shape of the mouth is an important consideration when trying to identify a Scottish wildcat. In short, the Scottish wildcat has an enormous jaw. The rest of the wildcat’s bone structure is just a little bit bigger than that of a domestic cat, but the jaw is relatively huge.</p>
                <p>The biggest threat to the Scottish Wildcat is hybridisation.  More specifically, when genetically pure wildcats mate with feral cats instead of other wildcats, the gene pool becomes diluted and the species (Felis Sylvestris) literally breeds itself out of existense. <a href="https://www.wildcathaven.com/scottish-wildcat" target="_blank">(Wildcat Haven)</a></p>

                <p>Well-furred cats from the cold Asian steppes, Pallas’s Cats Otocolobus manul are also called Manul, Steppe Cat or Rock Wildcat.</p>
                <p>There have been very few studies conducted about the Pallas’s cat. Recent and ongoing studies from Mongolia and Russia have increased the knowledge base. This includes insight in its ecology and current threats from numerous radio-collared Pallas’s cats in Mongolia. Research has highlighted the importance of improving protection within and outside of protected areas. Despite 12% of the Pallas’s cat’s distribution in Mongolia lying within protected areas, illegal hunting is still frequent in these areas and Pallas’s cat’s large home range sizes may result in the species being difficult to protect within reserves. Protection of Pallas’s cats within reserves in Russia has increased and approximately 13% of the species’ range in Russia lies now within protected areas.</p>
                <p>Since 2012, the Pallas’s Cat Working Group (PCWG) has existed as a network consisting of around 30 members from range countries as well as international experts. PCWG aims to unite efforts of specialists in Pallas’s cat study and conservation all over its global range.</p>
                <p>In 2016, the Pallas’s cat International Conservation Alliance (PICA) was founded. PICA is a collaboration between the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, Nordens Ark Zoo of Sweden and the Snow Leopard Trust, funded by Fondation Segré. PICA aims to increase the knowledge on Pallas’s cat distribution and suitable survey techniques, on Pallas’s cat basic ecology, improve awareness and communication, and develop a Conservation Action Plan.
